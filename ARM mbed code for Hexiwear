/*Hexiwear comes with lot of in-built sensors such as humidity,temperature,pressure,
heart rate(MAX30101),haptic feedback,accelerometer,gyroscope and much more...!!
This enables Hexiwear to be used for different applications such as smart watch & smarthome controller.
Hexiwear has an in-built heart rate sensor(MAX30101) that is pre-configured to calculate the heart rate. 
MAX30101 has 3 modes of operation
1.Heart rate mode
2.SPO2 mode
3.Both
Since several sensors are connected to the I2C bus it is neccessary to identify and segregate the part of max30101.
It is done by enabling the mode and the sensor we need to activate*/
